# REACT+TypeScript - GitHub User Finder

This is a simple web application built with **React** and **TypeScript** that allows users to search for GitHub profiles by username. The app fetches data from the GitHub API and displays the user's profile information, including their repositories, followers, and more.

## Purpose

The main goal of developing this project was to practice and deepen my knowledge of **TypeScript** in the context of a React-based application. Throughout the development process, I aimed to integrate TypeScript features and practices effectively.

## Features

- Search for GitHub users by username.
- Display basic profile information such as name, avatar, bio, and location.
- Show a list of repositories with details like name, description, and stars.
- View the number of followers and following.
- Responsive design for both mobile and desktop screens.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end framework for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Used to bring type safety and better development experience.
- **GitHub API**: For fetching user data.
- **CSS Modules**: For styling the components.
